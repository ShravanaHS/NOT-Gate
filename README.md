# NOT Gate

In this repository, I am designing and analyzing a CMOS Inverter / NOT Gate using the SkyWater PDK 130nm Technology. 

The design is created using 
<a href="https://xschem.sourceforge.io/stefan/index.html" target="_blank">xschem</a>, 
and its parameters(plots) are obtained through pre-layout simulations using 
<a href="https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/" target="_blank">ngspice</a>.

For the layout design, I am utilizing the 
<a href="http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/" target="_blank">Magic VLSI Layout Tool</a>, 
a widely used open-source tool for IC design.


## Abstract 

This repository deals with the design and implementation of CMOS Inverter using SkyWater 130nm CMOS technology.
A NOT Gate, also known as an Inverter, is a fundamental digital logic gate that produces an output opposite to its input. It operates based on the principle of logical negation in Boolean algebra.

Function
If the input is HIGH (logic 1), the output is LOW (logic 0).
If the input is LOW (logic 0), the output is HIGH (logic 1).
